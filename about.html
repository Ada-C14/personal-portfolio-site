            <h1>About Me</h1>
            <p>Hi there! My name is Roshni (she/her) and I'm currently a student in Cohort 14 at <a target="_blank" href="https://adadevelopersacademy.org/">Ada Developers Academy</a>. Before Ada, I was finishing up my last semester of college at <a target="_blank" href="https://www.wesleyan.edu">Wesleyan University</a>, where I majored in Neuroscience & Behavior, Psychology, and Science in Society. During my time in college, I became involved in research and had the opportunity to work on projects studying autonomic nervous system disorders in children, cognitive remediation in schizophrenia patients, children’s emotional development, among many other topics. Most, if not all, of these experiences exposed me to programming, in particular statistical programming, and showed me the ways in which these fields intersect and how I can write programs to answer important research questions.<br><br> Since my first research experience in my sophomore year of college (Spring ’18), I wanted to learn more about programming and what I could do with a career in software development. After realizing it was too late to change my major, I decided to research different options for pursuing a career in the field without a computer science degree (bootcamps, second bachelor’s degree, master’s degree, etc.), and, after hours of research, I found Ada. I was so excited about the program, but I knew I wouldn’t be able to apply for nearly two years, so I simply bookmarked the website and set a calendar reminder. Fast forward two years and I’m now a Cohort 14 student at Ada learning Ruby, HTML, CSS, Rails, Javascript, etc. I’m so incredibly grateful for this opportunity and can’t wait to see what’s ahead in this new journey for my cohort mates and I.</p>
