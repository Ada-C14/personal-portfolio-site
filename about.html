                <p>Currently I am a Systems Developer student at Ada Developers Academy. I also have a background in Business Admininistration with over 10 years experience as a Business Analist. As a student at Ada Development Academy I am learning Ruby, HTML, CSS and Computer Sciences Fundamentals.  I still have a long way to go, but I am amazed at how much I have been able to learn. One of my best personality traits is that I never giveup, I always finish what I start no matter what chanllenges I encounter. I also believe that when you are positive and put forth the effort you can conquer whatever you put your mind to. In my free time there are several things I enjoy doing, but not limited to: traveling, cooking, baking, comedies movies, outdoor adventures, Mediterranean food, red wines, coffee, dancing, good music and long conversations with family and friends.</p>
