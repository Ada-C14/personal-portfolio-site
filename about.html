      <h1>My Journey into Programming</h1>
      <p>What sparked my interest in coding was using Microsoft Power Automate to improve processes at my workplace. 
        I previously worked as a prosthetist orthotist, fitting patients with prosthetic limbs and bracing. 
        I was frustrated that many of our existing processes were redundant. 
        So, to automate those time-consuming tasks,  I created workflows in Power Automate and learned the basics of conditionals, loops, and arrays.</p>
        
        <p>I quickly realized that I enjoyed the problem-solving aspect, like solving a puzzle. 
        One could say I was a bit obsessed.Sometimes I would finish seeing a patient and immediately get back to working on optimizing a workflow. 
        I was surprised how much I found myself relishing the feeling when a process I had improved was now working as intended and much more efficiently than before. 
        Just as with patient care, programming requires creative problem solving. 
        It is different everyday and mentally stimulating.</p>

        <p>As a health professional, I see the potential in programming to improve health outcomes. 
        With programming, I can help a wider audience. 
        I've worked personally with hundreds of patients but with web and software development, I could potentially reach millions of people. 
        Whether through improving accessibility of clinical resources on a website, or improving patient education with an app, there is potential to make a greater impact with coding.</p>
