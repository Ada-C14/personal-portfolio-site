        <h2>A LITTLE ABOUT ME</h2>
        <p>
             I am originally from Peru in South America. When I was in high school, I discovered my passion for science but especially for mathematics. When I was 19 years old my family and I migrated to the U.S.A. to start a new life. After many hours studying full time and working part time, I obtained my Bachelor of Science in Mathematics. Out of ten students graduating with a Mathematics degree, I was one of four females and the only latino woman. I am very proud of myself for that!

            After graduating, I married an American soldier and had lived overseas for the past 6 years. We spent three years living in South Korea where I was able to learn how to read and write in Hangul and learned their culture. The last three years, we were stationed in Germany and we have experienced the European culture as well. After 10 years of military service, last October we finished our service and moved to Washington State where my spouse is from.

            Being a military spouse and continuing my professional career has been challenging these last 10 years. Even though I have had the best opportunity to know and appreciate the Asian culture and the European culture, I had to put on hold my professional career while supporting my spouse’s. Even though, I have stayed current with my mathematics skills teaching all levels of math; and also created mathematical content for distance learning websites, the un/under employment rates for military spouses is about 25-30% in the nation affecting our moral and economical success as professionals and as a family. But now that we are out of the military service, I am ready to start a new chapter in my professional career and I am fierce to show my potential.

            The past year, I decided that I wanted to complement my mathematics degree with software skills and knowledge of data analysis to make myself more competitive on today’s workplace. The past few months I started taking online courses and learned the basics of Python, SQL, Ruby and C#. I had a great time learning them and I feel I can learn and do more in the software engineering field. While talking to friends and family, they mentioned Ada Developers Academy as a great, affordable opportunity to obtain knowledge through their Software Development program and start networking. When I did my research, I loved the curricula but especially their mission of helping women and underrepresented minorities like me, giving them the opportunity to show their knowledge and skills to the tech industry and that we can be successful doing that with the right resources and network. 
        </p>
        <p>
            Last March, I submitted my application to Ada Developers Academy and got accepted in to the program. As of right now, I am on my journey to become a Software Engineer and I am very thankful for this opportunity.  Let's keep coding!
