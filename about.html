        <p>Hello! I'm a student at Ada Developer's Academy. I consider myself a Washington native but have spent portions of my life in California, Oregon and Hawaii. I love to boulder in my spare time, take care of plants and promote intersectional feminist ideals as much as I can. Although my journey with software development is young, I've worked hard to take control of my life and dedicate it to a career field I am truly passionate about. Women and gender-diverse individuals in the tech industry are severely underrepresented; by achieving my dream job in the tech world, I hope to be a part of the newest generation of tech and work towards breaking down these historic barriers.</p>
