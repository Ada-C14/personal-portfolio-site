            <h2>About Me</h2>
            <p>Hi, I'm Denise Soares, and my pronouns are she/her. I was born in Brazil and moved to the United States in 2017; since then, I live in the beautiful Seattle, surrounded by art, music, good food and lots of trees. In my free time, I try to spend as much time outdoors as I can, either by travelling long distances or by exploring my surroundings.</p>
