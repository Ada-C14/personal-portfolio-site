    <h2>About</h2>

    <h1>Heloooooo</h1>

    <p>I live in Seattle, WA and am a software engineering student at Ada Developers Academy. I work mainly in Ruby, and am now getting to dabble in HTML/CSS/Ruby on Rails (love that for me). Previously I worked at a global health research center and was pursuing my Master in Public Health. In my previous role was where I was introduced to coding and became hooked and knew I wanted to learn more!</p>

    <p>In my free time I like to reminisce about when I could get on a plane without worrying about catching a deadly virus and read! Thanks for stopping by! 👋🏾</p>
