            <p class="text">Welcome to my website! I am currently a student at the Ada Developer's Academy in Seattle Washington. I grew up in Bothell, Washington and graduated in 2018 from the University of Washington with a degree in Biology. I got my first job as a Research Associate at the Allen Institute for Brain Science. There I studied the neural pathways, specifically the visual system, of the mouse brain. While working at the institute, I was working closely with engineers troubleshooting problems with the house-made technology that our experiments were run with. After seeing what these engineers did day to day, I was very interested in software engineering. I had already decided to not pursue my original path of getting a PhD in neuroscience, so I was actively looking for a new career path. I heard about Ada through a coworker and loved the mission of increasing diversity in the tech sector, as well as give women and gender diverse people a chance to enter this industry with no prior experience. Ultimately, I applied and was accepted in June 2020 which led me to where I am now! My hobbies include happy hour, binge watching reality tv, watching football.</p>
