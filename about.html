                    <h2>Hi, my name is Sophia and I am so happy you found this site!</h2>
                    <p>I am a first-generation American (Filipino) living in the beautiful city of Seattle.</p>
    
                    <p>I have dedicated the past two years to changing careers and creating a solid foundation to join the Seattle Tech Industry.</p>
                        
                    <p>In August 2020, I became a member of Ada (Cohort 14). 
                        During this time I have completed weekly projects and assignments that have built and strengthened my skillset in fullstack development. </p>
                    
                    <p>In my time away from studying, I love volunteering with youth in my community, spending time outdoors, traveling,
                        immersing myself in all things programming, and most of allâ€“spending time with my furry friends.</p>
