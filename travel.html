            Travelling is probably one of the things I enjoy the most. I have made it my goal to take at least one international trip a year. I wanted to sharer with you some of my favorite trips and memories over the years. I hope you enjoy.

        <p>
            While I was a junior at Western Washington University, I decided to study abroad to             Seoul South Korea.  I applied and was accepted to Yonsei University which is one of                South Korea's Ivy League Universities. I had the pleasure of living in Seoul for six                 months.While I was studying at Yonsei University, I took classes on Korean history, and the          Korean language. I loved my experience in Seoul, being able to see the old history of South Korea      mixed with modern architecture. It was truly facinating.

            Some of my Seoul highlights include:
