            Travelling is one of the things I enjoy the most. I have made it my goal to take at least one international trip a year. During the majority of my travels I've had the pleasure of being able to travel with my fiance. I hope you enjoy learning about the trips and memories that I've taken over the years.

        <img src="images/yonsei.jpg" alt="Ana at Yonsei University" />

        <p>
        While I was a junior at Western Washington University, I decided to study abroad to Seoul South Korea.  I applied and was accepted to Yonsei University which is one of  South Korea's Ivy League Universities. I had the pleasure of living in Seoul for six months.While I was studying at Yonsei University, I took classes on Korean history, and the Korean language. I loved my experience in Seoul, being able to see the old history of South Korea mixed with modern architecture. It was truly facinating.

        <p>
            While I was studying abroad I had the opportunity to visit Hong Kong with some friends from college. However, the second time I visited Hong Kong, I really enjoyed my stay as I knew how to take my fiance around the city fairly well. Hong Kong is one of my favorite cities I've ever visited due to its delicious food and its modern architecture. One of my highlights was going to an "afternoon high-tea" at the Ritz Carleton Hotel. The view was spectacular and atmosphere was so posh! It gave me and fiance and opportunity dress-up while we travelled and it was so much fun!

        <p>
            Next on our Asia trip adventure we visited Shanghai, China. This was my first time in mainland China and the weekend that we visited happened to be a national labor day holiday. The streets were packed with people, and unfortunatley due to the large amount of crowds, I didnt enjoy the city too much. It didnt help that it was super humid!

        <img src="images/wall1.jpg" alt="Great Wall of China" style="width:100%">

        <p>
            Visiting China was always on my bucket-list. However, what really excited me was being able to finally see and walk the "Great Wall of China". After doing a lot of research, we decided to embark our Great Wall of China adventure by doing a private hiking tour! We began at the Jiankou section and hiked to the well-known stretch at Mutianyu. As we hiked we learned about the history of china, the Great Wall and then enjoyed a nice dinner at a local restaurant. It was an all-day trip but really well-worth it! We also had the opportunity to visit the Forbidden City in the heart of Beijing. We really enjoyed our trip to China!

        <img src="images/Prague.jpg" alt="Prague " />
        <p>
            Next on our itenirary was the Czech Republic. We took a trian from Berlin to Prague.  We rented a beautiful airbnb studio, just a few minutes away from downtown Prague. We had the opportunity to visit various Christmas Markets, try local cuisine, which was plain in my opinion and was not impressed! We also enjoyed touring the Pražský Hrad (Prague Castle). On our last evening in Prague we went to classical music concert which was divine!

            The last stop of my Europe trip was Madrid, Spain. My best friend was living there and she invited us to visit. We had the best time sightseeing and we visited the Royal Palace of Madrid, the San Miguel Market and just strolled through the city. We also ended up spending  New Years there and celebrated "Los Reyes Magos" or the Three Wise Men, which happens to be Spain's "Christmas" celebration.

        <img src="images/chihuahua1.jpg" alt="Visiting the Coupolas in Santa Isabel">
<p>
    Although I was born and raised in Chihuahua Mexico and I visit my hometown often. I havent had the opportunity to tour or got sightseeing. In 2015, I took my boyfriend to Mexico for the first time and our first stop was my hometown of Chihuahua. We spent some time with my family before taking the Chihuahua Pacifico Train to visit "Barrancas del Cobre" which are located at the Copper Canyon. Once we arrived at our hotel, we ended up zip-lining through the Copper Canyon. Our the zipline was 2545 meters (8,350 feet) long with a max registered speed of 135 km/hr (84 mph). Chihuahua has the longest zip line of any kind in the world, with a vertical drop of 450 meters. Needless to say, we enjoyed our adventure!
