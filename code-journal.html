        <p>The programming idea seed was planted in my brain garden November 2019. My sister and brother-in-law mentioned, off-hand, maybe I should try it, I might like it. The next day, I discovered Codecademy and almost instantly knew, this was the thing. While working three jobs - Baker, high school tutor, and cooking assistant at a culinary school - I started teaching myself coding on the side. I started with HTML before I discovered Ada Developer's Academy. Once I saw their mission statement I knew I had found the school.</p>
        <p>Once March came around I zeroed in on the Ada application. Once I finished that, I focused on the code challenge.</p>
