            안녕하세요 여러분~!
          </p>
          <p>
            왜 한국어로 쓰고 있습니까 물어 보고 싶죠. 며칠 전에 갑자기 사촌에게서 전화가 왔어요. 놀랐어요. 놀랐고 행복해 줬습니다. 왜냐하면 같이 한국어를 배우고 싶다고 했어요!
          </p>
          <p>
            사촌이 한국어를 배우고 싶은 게 오래 알고 있었는데, 이제까지 우리 계획이나 안 세웠어요. 그리고 제가 오랜만에 한국어를 안쓰고 배웠던 걸 잃어버리면 잃어버릴 수록 점점 슬퍼졌어요.
          </p>
          <p>
            그래서 그 얘기로부터 한국어로 쓰는 영감을 받았습니다. 실수 많이 해도 좋은 연습이 된다고 생각했어요.

              Hi everyone~!
            </p>
            <p>
              You are probably wondering why I wrote in Korean. Well, a few days ago I got a call from my cousin. I was suprised she called. Pleasantly suprised and happy she did. She asked if we could study Korean together!
            </p>
            <p>
              I knew for some time now that she was interested in learning Korean, but so far we've never really made plans to actually study together. Another reason I was happy to get her call is because I haven't been using what I'd learned, and have slowly but surely been losing those skills, which of course is sad to think about.
            </p>
            <p>
              So after that conversation, I was inspired to write this journal entry in Korean. Even though I know I will have a lot of mistakes in my writing, I thought it would be a good way to start practicing.
            </p>
            <p>
              Thanks for taking the time to read me post~!^^
            </p>

              ~배움의 길은 일생의 - learning is a lifelong journey~
              I hope means what I intended it too. In any case, let's do our best and learn together ;)
