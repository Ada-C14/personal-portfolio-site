                        <h1>Something, something - it's a marathon, <a>not a sprint.</a></h1>
                        <p>
                            TBH, I suck at running, so both options above sound like rather unfortunate events, 
                            and frankly, the marathon sounds much more grueling... like <a class="special">sheesh</a> we have to do this 
                            for a whole metaphorical 26+ miles??
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            That aside, I am writing today to wax poetic about the <a class="special">journey</a>.
                            (And if you thought that may have been a nod towards Karate Kid's "Wax on, wax off" 
                            then we are very much so on the same wavelength.)
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            I would define my 20s as a string of hard and (if I were lucky) fast failures - 
                            mostly because I would do things for the entirely wrong reasons and think that I would 
                            somehow just "deal with it," as if I were staying up late for just one deadline this one time.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            Except it's never just <a class="special">one</a> deadline but instead, a series of unending deadlines, 
                            thrust into life by work, family, society, and basically anything and anyone I would listen to just so that 
                            I can steadfastly carry those anxieties along with me.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            But college Anna reminded me to live like I'm traveling budget and to dump the baggage. (Kidding.)
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            Stream of consciousness is petering out...
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            <a class="special">tl;dr:</a> I'm having fun walking the marathon.
