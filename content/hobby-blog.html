                            <p>I find that software engineering requires a lot of creativity. I am a very creative person, and love to spend my free time painting. I like to experiment with different mediums. However, I tend to gravitate back to acrylic on canvas or watercolor on paper. Below are some of my art pieces, a bit of information about each piece, including the medium used to realize it.</p>
