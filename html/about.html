                <h1>About Me</h1>
                <p> When I'm not coding, there are several things I LOVE to do. I love singing (though i'm not actually good at it) and dancing for fun. Occasionally, I try to find new, healthy and tasty recipes that even my parents can enjoy. It makes me very happy seeing others love the food that I make. Also love to stay in and binge watch something on netflix. Playing tennis with good company is another hobby that I wish I had more time for. When I have the time and money, nothing beats traveling to new places all over the world. I'm also slightly obsessed with Twitter.   </p>
