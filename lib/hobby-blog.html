        <h3>My Secret Life Advice for Everyone: Do Improv</h3>
        <p>Improv makes you think on your feet.</p>
        <p>It impowers you to go "I'm not enjoying this scene, I'm just gonna nope on out" or "I no longer like what I'm doing, I'm going to do something entirely different until I do feel good about what I'm doing."</p>
        <p>Improv teaches you to have a stage ego - to believe that you deserve to take up space.</p>

        <h3>MOVIES</h3>
        <p>I don't actually watch that many new movies anymore</p>
        <p>But wow I sure love talking about them</p>

        <p>Also complaining that they are too long nowadays</p>

        <h3>Writing</h3>
        <p>Much like coding, writing fiction involves a lot of starting new projects and then immediately getting distracted by the least important aspects of the project and/or ideas for an even newer, shinier project.</p>
        <p>But you can actually get paid for coding.</p>
        <p>To be fair, I do not actually want to have to write fiction to someone else's specifications.</p>
