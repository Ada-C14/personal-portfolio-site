        <h3>Improv: It's good for you</h3>
        <p>Improv makes you think on your feet and encourages you to take weird big risks. It teaches you to have a stage ego - to believe that you deserve to take up space. It can even be a workout, if you make the same mistake I do of frequently making bizarre physical choices you then have to keep doing for the rest of the scene.</p>
        <p>It empowers you to get out of situations where you don't feel good. I have gotten so much practice at saying "I'm not enjoying this scene, I'm just gonna nope on out" or "I'm no longer having fun with what I'm doing, I'm going to do something entirely different until I do feel good about what I'm doing."</p>
        <p>Plus, if you tell people you do improv, they think you are brave, who doesn't want that.</p>

        <h3>Let's Go to the Movies</h3>
        <p>JK I don't actually watch that many new movies anymore.</p>
        <p>But I still love talking about them! I literally have a degree in talking about movies I haven't seen.</p>
        <p>I especially enjoy complaining that movies are too long these days, and talking about behind the scenes trivia. Favorite thing I learned recently: Michael Caine based his character in Children of Men off of John Lennon, who he used to be friends with. He was so in character that when his wife visited the set she didn't recognize him.</p>

        <h3>Writing Fiction is the Exact Same Thing as Writing Code</h3>
        <p>Both involve taking the original beautiful perfect idea in your head and breaking it into smaller pieces. Both involve spending frustratingly large amounts of time on details that just <em>refuse</em> to come out right. Both involve being surprised by sudden moments of invention involved in something you didn't even know was going to be a part of the project in the first place. Both involve a lot of starting new projects and then immediately getting distracted by the least important aspects of the project and/or ideas for an even newer, shinier project.</p>
        <p>The essential difference is you can actually get paid to write code, but to be fair, fiction is more fun when you aren't doing it for money.</p>
