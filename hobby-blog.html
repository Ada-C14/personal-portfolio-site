            <p class="blog">These images represent a larger photographic archive. The archive consists of images documenting fake rock
                electrical boxes. The environments, textures, installation and overall design are all of concern in the
                photographic exercise. The example images were collected Fall 2019. To add to the archive please reach out

            <p><em id="benjamin_quote" class="blog">“A Klee painting named 'Angelus Novus' shows an angel looking as though he is
                about to move away from something he is fixedly contemplating. His eyes are staring, his mouth is open,
                his wings are spread. This is how one pictures the angel of history. His face is turned toward the past.
                Where we perceive a chain of events, he sees one single catastrophe which keeps piling wreckage upon
                wreckage and hurls it in front of his feet. The angel would like to stay, awaken the dead, and make whole
                what has been smashed. But a storm is blowing from Paradise; it has got caught in his wings with such
                violence that the angel can no longer close them. This storm irresistibly propels him into the future to
                which his back is turned, while the pile of debris before him grows skyward. This storm is what we call
                progress.” </em></p>
