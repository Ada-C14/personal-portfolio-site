               Yesterday was raining but the skies are clear again. I've still hoarded my bells from the raccoon overlord. I have enough to pay off my final installment to him but have  yet to do so. I believe it may be fear of the unknown. I have grown so accostomed to being in debt and reliant on the whims of the animals around me. I don't how I would function without the security of this holding me back. Like a hamster on a wheel (don't tell Hamlet) I continue forward on my circle leading to nowhere.

                I've slowly begun rebuilding the island that I had decimated. Despite the dying leaves of fall I feel like I am rebirthing this land into my own image. As the trees die my design only becomes stronger. The raccoon minions have begun selling candy but have rationed it to only one per day. Another example of them wielding too much power over the people. Driving up the price through the short supply before All Hallow's Eve. I feel no need to become a power hungry capitalist like they have at such a young age. Instead, I wield the very land to my own designs.

                I feel the cool breath of autumn on the wind. The mysterious balloons bring with them new ideas for creations involving acorns and pine cones. Unfortunately, I've gone mad. I've chopped all of the trees in the north of the island. Broken down every cliff and filled all of the rivers. As soon as I was done and saw the devastation I caused I wept. I thought I could create something even more beautiful on this island, but I'm no longer certain.
