        <h3>Climbing is my other passion!</h3>
        <p>Specifally bouldering. Bouldering is essentially free climbing. Shorter, more dynamic projects.</p>
        <p>Climbing and getting strong has proved to be extremely empowering for me. As a small, biologically female person, it's really nice being strong. Being able to hold my own, being the one to open pickle jars in my relationships, feels nice, to say the least.</p>
