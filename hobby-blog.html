        <h3>Climbing is my other passion!</h3>
        <p>Specifally bouldering. Bouldering is essentially free climbing. Shorter, more dynamic projects.</p>
        <p>Climbing and getting strong has proved to be extremely empowering for me. As a small, biologically female person, it's really nice being strong. Climbing has also taught me to try hard and problem solve.</p>
        <h3>Collecting Rocks!</h3>
        <p>Rocks are cool. I have a huge collection of rocks and crystals at home, both that I've collected and bought.</p>
        <h3>Cacti!</h3>
        <p>Though I'm a slightly incompetent plant mom, I'm working on it. Cacti, however, I can usually keep alive! They don't need much water and are pretty resilient.</p>
