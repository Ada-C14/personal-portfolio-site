                        <p>I'm a student at <a href="https://adadevelopersacademy.org/" target="_blank">Ada Developers Academy</a> in Seattle, WA. I've started my Ada journey this summer, and I expect myself to become a skilled and confident full-stack software engineer when I graduate from Ada in 2021!</p>

                        <p>Before Ada, because of my background in Chemistry and Pharmaceutical sciences, I used to work in the fields of medicine research and drug development. I plan to use what I've learned from Ada and applied them to solve the problems in those fields.</p>

                        <p>When I'm not coding or working, there are several things that I like to do. I like to travel, go hiking, and take pictures of nature. I also love food and enjoying eating. If it's raining outside, especially in Seattle it rains all the time in winter, I enjoy drinking my coffee while listening to classical music and reading. I usually read fantasy, history, memoir, sci-fi, or self-help books.</p>
