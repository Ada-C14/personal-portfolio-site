                        <p>i sometimes do art commissions where i draw emotes for people's tabletop rpg characters.
                            this is a calculator i coded to figure out how much certain commissions would cost.

                    <h2>calculator.</h2>
                    <p>my very first project as a cohort 14 adie student. yes, it's another calculator. 
                        but it also helped me conquer a weird fear of regex.</p>

                    <p>a CLI program written at ada to learn about some of our planets in the solar system. currently only supports two planets,
                        but i'd say they're pretty neat ones. you can even add info about your own!</p>

                    <p>library code written for an ada project to store orders of a grocery store using object-oriented programming. it was one
