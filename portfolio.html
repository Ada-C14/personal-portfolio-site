                <p>For this project we used the Slack API in order to let us list users and channels, get details on users and channels, and send messages to users or channels, all from a Ruby program. Why we interacted with Slack using its API, and not its web-app? </p>

                <p>We built a Ruby library that loads lists of passengers, trips and drivers from CSV files, provided methods for exploring this data, and provided a way to request a new trip. We used our understanding of classes, methods and attributes to create an object-oriented ride share system.</p>

                <p>An anagram is a word or phrase performed by rearranging the letters, it has a specific scoring system. While working on Adagrams, it helped me to think of a physical metaphor for the game, such as other common word games like Scrabble, these analog games all feature a pool of letter tiles that the player draws from.</p>
